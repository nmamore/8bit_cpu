# 8bit_cpu
My attempt to make a softcore processor on FPGA.
This is purely a learning experience for myself to better understand how CPUs work. Any suggestions/thoughts are greatly appreciated.
Built using various guidance from nand2tetris (https://www.nand2tetris.org/) and Ben Eater's 8-bit CPU (https://eater.net/8bit)
Hardware is the DE-10 Lite from Terasic. Simulations performed in ModelSim 2020.1. IDE is Quartus Prime 20.1
